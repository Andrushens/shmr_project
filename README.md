### All requirements & extra requirements (but landscape & high resolution screens are as usual, though I think they look normal). Through them:

- Offline-first (patch implemented by interceptor & on startapp)
- Delivery to Firebase App Distribution
- Android flavors: dev & prod (difference in app icon)
- Switch theme on phone shake & save its state in preferences
- Android sdk 30+ strech scroll
- Tests: TaskCubit - 84.6%, HomeCubit - 71.7%
